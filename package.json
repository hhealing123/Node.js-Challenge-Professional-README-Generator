The following [README Guide](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/github/professional-readme-guide) is a good resource that will guide through creating a high-quality, professional README. The application will be invoked by using the following commande 'node index.js'. Note that this weekly challenge will not be deployed; however, a link to walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality will be needed. 'Screencastify' will be used to make video of demonstration of functionalities.",
